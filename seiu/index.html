        <h4>At SEIU, I built a user-centered design and engineering team from the ground up. My team replaced decades-old software that handled all critical financial and membership data. We conducted a modular deployment over 9 months. We ultimately delivered software that was on time and under budget. From the earliest stages of design, I balanced the needs of both internal and external users. The final product increased net revenue by more than 8% and reduced dues billing errors by more than 90%. As a consultant, I deployed the product at locals across the country with similar success.

          <!-- In 2009, after several years of working as a contract artist, developer and campaign organizer, I took a permanent position at SEIU in Portland, OR. I began as a data analyst, but soon automated my position and took it upon myself to bring our membership and financial data systems into the 21st century. By diving deep into a piece of unexamined vendor software, I was able to discover and eliminate an error-rate of nearly 20% in dues collection that was causing a net revenue loss of over 5%. Moreover, while actually increasing the amount of dues we collected from our members, I was able to reduce complaints on the dues hotline by 10x.<br><br>I leveraged the trust I had built by successfully patching our 22(!) year old legacy software system to cultivate a series of data and technology advocates within the union administration, as well as on the (elected) executive board. I spent that social capital on a new central data-system, ultimately securing a budget and full responsibility. After several vendor consultations, I decided to swallow my fear as a novice technologist and build an in-house system from scratch.<br><br>Over the course of 8 months, I contracted a team of developers, performed user research, designed the system, managed the engineering using (then nascent) sprint-and-scrum best practices, and ultimately delivered an on-time, on-budget deployment that faced our internal team, as well as the financial and hr departments of our members' 50 employers. The new system would ultimately recapture lost annual revenue totaling more than 10% of our net income, while drastically reducing member dues issues and increasing the fairness of deductions across different types of members.<br><br>I went on to independently consult for SEIU, deploying the system at other locals. Five years after accidentally boostrapping myself in the role, having become completely hooked on user research and the management of technology products, I returned to school to sharpen my skills and broaden my awareness of the cultural and logistical issues facing civic tech deployments. -->
